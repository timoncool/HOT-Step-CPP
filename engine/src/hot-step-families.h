// hot-step-families.h — Registry of in-process model families riding on
// ace-server (MiniMax-Music3 today, YuE2 next).
//
// The two boot gates in hot-step-server.cpp used to ask "is MM3 present?" by
// naming mm3_weights_present() directly. That question generalises to "can
// ANY in-process family still serve?" — this header answers it without the
// two gate call sites having to know how many families exist or what any of
// them are named. Each family keeps its own cheap probe (directory/filename
// scan only, no weight reads, no GGUF header parse — see mm3_weights_present
// itself for the shape a probe should take).
//
// INCLUDE ORDER (load-bearing, do not "fix"): this header does NOT
// `#include "minimax/mm3-model.h"` or "minimax/mm3-server.h". mm3-model.h's
// own header comment is explicit that nothing outside engine/src/minimax/ may
// include it — the single approved wire-in is hot-step-server.cpp's
// `#include "minimax/mm3-server.h"` hook (checked by verify-hooks.ps1). This
// header instead relies on that include having already happened EARLIER in
// the same translation unit, so `mm3_weights_present` (declared `static` in
// mm3-model.h) is already visible by name when g_hot_step_families below is
// initialised. Concretely: in hot-step-server.cpp this header must be
// `#include`d AFTER "minimax/mm3-server.h" (:86), in the same file. It is not
// safe to include from anywhere else, or before that line, today — it has
// exactly one consumer. A second consumer TU would need mm3_weights_present
// to stop being `static` first (drop `static`, or add an `inline` non-static
// shim in mm3-model.h); that is a minimax/ change, out of scope here, and
// NOT made by this patch (see APPLY.md).
#include <string>

// sa3_weights_present lives in its own header (sa3-families.h) rather than
// riding a hook include the way mm3_weights_present and yue2_weights_present
// do: SA3 has no "sa3-server.h" subtree hook in hot-step-server.cpp for this
// header to rely on having been included earlier in the TU (see sa3-families.h's
// own comment for why), so it is safe — and necessary — to include directly
// here instead of forward-declaring it.

// name here — same "earlier #include in the same TU" contract this file's
// own header comment documents for mm3_weights_present. No forward
// declaration here (a non-static one would conflict with yue2-model.h's own
// `static` definition) — same reason mm3_weights_present has none either.

// C++17 inline variable: exactly one definition across however many TUs end
// up including this header (today: one), so g_hot_step_families itself is
// never an ODR hazard even though the array is `constexpr` and one of its
