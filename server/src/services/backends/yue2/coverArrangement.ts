// The arrangement contract for build by section (yue2Takes.ts). A build used
// to compose the score's sections in source order; an arrangement lets the
// output skip, reorder and repeat them. Nothing imports this file yet: the
// session work that adopts it (cover-local lyrics, then arrangement support)
// follows these rules rather than inventing its own.
//
// Why the composed prompt is enough (engine/src/yue2/yue2-pipeline.h): every
// /yue2/synth request tokenizes style + lyrics + abc into one prompt and
// prefills the cache from scratch (yue2_run_semantic_stage), then
// teacher-forces codec_ids and samples on (continue_codec_ids). Nothing reads
// sections apart from the score text itself, and the NAR chunks copy the same
// prompt rows (yue2_seal_chunks). So a take of a reordered song is an ordinary
// take whose abc and lyrics are written out in output order. Three things
// follow:
//  - The prompt for occurrences already kept must not change, so their text
//    is a function of the kept prefix only (composeArrangement guarantees it).
//    Later text may change between takes; the engine re-prefills the prefix
//    codes under the new prompt and checks they come back verbatim.
//  - Save song must send the same composed abc and lyrics. Its NAR reads the
//    whole stream under the request's prompt, and generate.ts builds that
//    prompt from the job params, which hold the source score.
//  - A lyric schedule (C6) is built from the score's text, so it must be
//    rebuilt from the composed text, and a resumed take replays its prefix
//    under it.
//
// Identity, in the session file:
//  - Source sections are the score's own, in order: ids s0, s1, ... The score
//    never changes within a session (a new score is a new session).
//  - Occurrences are the output, in order: ids o0, o1, ... from a counter that
//    never reuses one, so two choruses, or a chorus removed and added back,
//    are different occurrences.
//  - A take's from/to are occurrence indexes in the plan, and its starts are
//    indexed by occurrence. For a legacy session the plan is the identity,
//    so its from/to/starts already mean that.
//  - `revision` counts changes to what the next take would be sent (plan,
//    lyrics, settings). Every take records the revision and the parent (the
//    spine it resumed) it was made from. A mutation names the revision it
//    expects and fails on a mismatch; a take is kept only if it matches the
//    current revision and spine and composed the next planned occurrences.
//  - Keeping appends; undo pops. Neither changes the revision or the plan, so
//    a take made from a spine is keepable again after undoing back to it.
