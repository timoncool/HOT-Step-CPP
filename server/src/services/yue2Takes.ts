// YuE2 build by section: compose a cover a few sections at a time. A session
// holds the exact /yue2/synth request a one-shot render of the cover would
// send (built by the route from the same params), so every take is
// conditioned on the same prompt, score and lyrics. The "spine" is the last
// kept take. A take of sections [from, to] resumes the spine's codes up to
// where `from` starts in the spine's own audio (codec_ids +
// continue_codec_ids; the first takes resume nothing), composes with its own
// seed, and stops shortly after `to` (preview_max_frames). Keeping a take
// makes it the spine. Save song is an ordinary render job that prefills the
// spine's whole stream (generate.ts, params.yue2Build), so it gets the usual
// post-processing and library save. Section starts come from aligning the
// lyrics on each take's audio, because the score clock drifts from what the
// composer sings. Sessions are files under <audioDir>/takes/<id>/, so the
// /audio static route plays the takes. Sections are built in the
// arrangement's order (coverArrangement.ts): every take and Save song sends
// the score and lyrics written out in that order, and a take's from, to and
// starts index the arrangement's occurrences, never the score's sections.
// The spine can be cropped (cropBuildTake): the cut is a new take in its
// place, so the next take and Save song resume the cut stream and the
// original stays to be put back. A take may carry its own caption
// (generateBuildTakes): it changes what the AR composes for that take only.
// Every preview and Save song still decode the whole stream through NAR under
// one caption: the take's own for its preview, the session's for Save song.
